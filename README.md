# Stacks

This was an assignment done in the Program and Data Representation course at UVA. For this assignment, we were tasked with creating a postfix calculator that pushed and popped data onto a stack that we created.

I was responsible for encoding all the operators for the postfix calculator and the stack that the postfix calculator used. Note that this stack uses nodes instead of an array.
